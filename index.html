        <h2>Matched Pairs Mentorship Program Spring 2023</h2>
        <p>Matched Pairs is a mentorship program within the Stat & DS community,
          bringing together students from all different backgrounds. All students
          (undergraduate and graduate) of any gender indentity are encouraged to
          apply. Pairs will be assigned based on common interests, goals, and
          backgrounds which could include international student concerns,
          LGBTQ+ experiences, challenges with underrepresentation in STEM, and more.
          <br><br>
          We hope these mentor pairs last throughout the year and beyond!</p>
